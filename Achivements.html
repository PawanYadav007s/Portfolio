                    <p>I have completed a virtual internship program focused on the Cyber Security domain. This internship provided me with a robust understanding of various critical aspects of cybersecurity.

During the internship, I gained hands-on experience with Kali Linux, which is widely used for penetration testing and security auditing. I learned to perform various cyber attacks, enhancing my ability to identify and mitigate potential threats effectively.

One of the key components of the program was working with Bitnami WordPress, where I learned to secure web applications and understand common vulnerabilities in web platforms. Additionally, I explored Gmail Security, developing skills to protect email communications against phishing and other cyber threats.
